## Scope

This repository provides FedRAMP Moderate, High, and 20x-compliant AWS CloudFormation templates, designed to work in both AWS commercial and AWS GovCloud. Reports in scope include:

- Logic errors in templates that could weaken security posture (e.g. overly permissive IAM, unintended public exposure)
- Supply-chain concerns (malicious or unpinned dependencies, GitHub Actions)
- Secrets or credentials accidentally committed to this repo

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in AWS services themselves (report those to AWS), or issues in downstream forks/deployments not present in this repo's source.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest tagged release is actively supported. Older releases may not receive security fixes.
